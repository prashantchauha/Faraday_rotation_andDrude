# Faraday_rotation_andDrude
The above file 'Faraday_ratation_python.ipynb' (jupyter notebook) can be used to fit complex Faraday rotation due to cyclotron resonance from any system (especially 2DEGs).
The details and derivation of the expressions used in the above code are given in the file 'Fitting procedure.pdf'
